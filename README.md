# 🏥 Secure Health Access
### Zero Trust Healthcare Access Control System

---

## 📌 Overview

Secure Health Access is a Zero Trust-based healthcare security platform designed to protect sensitive patient information through strict access control, risk-based authentication, and tamper-evident logging.

The system ensures:

- 🔐 Secure authentication
- 🛡 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- 🚨 Emergency "Break-Glass" access
- 👤 Patient-controlled consent
- 📜 Tamper-evident audit logs
- 📊 Security monitoring dashboard

This project was built to demonstrate modern healthcare cybersecurity principles.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

### 🔐 Authentication & Risk Control
- Secure login system
- Risk-based authentication
- Device tracking
- Session validation

---

### 🛡 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

Supported roles:
- Admin
- Doctor
- Nurse
- Patient

Access to patient data is strictly controlled based on role and assignment.

---

### 👤 Patient Consent System
- Patients can grant doctor access
- Patients can revoke access anytime
- Time-limited consent permissions
- Consent validation before record access

---

### 🚨 Emergency Access (Break-Glass)
- Doctor must provide justification
- Temporary access granted
- Automatically expires
- Fully logged as high-risk activity

---

### 📜 Tamper-Evident Audit Logging
- All sensitive actions are logged
- Log hash chaining for integrity
- Audit verification system
- No modification allowed on logs

---

### 📊 Admin Security Dashboard
- Monitor high-risk logins
- Track emergency access
- View suspicious activity
- Verify audit integrity

---

## 🏗 Tech Stack

### Frontend
- React
- TypeScript
- Vite
- Tailwind CSS

### Backend / Database
- PostgreSQL
- PLpgSQL (for database-level logic)
